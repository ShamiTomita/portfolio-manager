Notes
Notes for portfolio Manager. I would really like to get this done by the end of March. I think thats a good timeline. By the end of march I will have a working protoype that I can use for my own purposes.

Now that I have the routes working I should be able to create 
1: a scrollable page. 
2: different sections.
3. those sections should be customizable.

So Things To Keep In Mind:
- this project needs to take into account different screen sizes, so will absolutely need to learn how to apply that
- it would be great to make it look nice of phone screens but not sure if that introduces a whole new game 


So Tasks: 
1. implement smooth scrolling 
2. learn custom screen displays 
3. figure out how to add customization 
4. implement rails models 
5. hook up rails to the react frontend, is it harder doing it this way or easier?
6. once most of this is built, I should then create an "admin" layer that allows for CRUD actions for the different sections.
7. find a way to host this
