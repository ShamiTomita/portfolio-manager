Notes
Notes for portfolio Manager. I would really like to get this done by the end of March. I think thats a good timeline. By the end of march I will have a working protoype that I can use for my own purposes.

Now that I have the routes working I should be able to create 
1: a scrollable page. 
2: different sections.
3. those sections should be customizable.

So Things To Keep In Mind:
- this project needs to take into account different screen sizes, so will absolutely need to learn how to apply that
- it would be great to make it look nice of phone screens but not sure if that introduces a whole new game 


So Tasks: 
1. implement smooth scrolling 
2. learn custom
